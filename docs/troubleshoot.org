* Troubleshooting
ðŸ’¡ TIP: Run ~:checkhealth orgmode~ to check if Orgmode is correctly installed and configured.

** Indentation is not working

Make sure you are not overriding indentexpr in Org buffers with [[https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter#indentation][nvim-treesitter indentation]]

** I get ~treesitter/query.lua~ errors when opening agenda/capture prompt or org files

Tree-sitter parser might not be installed.
Try running ~:Org install_treesitter_grammar~ to reinstall it.

** I get =.../orgmode/parser/org.so is not a valid Win32 application= on Windows

This issue can happen due to wrong C compiler being used for building the parser.
By default, first one available from this list is chosen: =cc, gcc, clang, cl, zig=
If you want to use a specific parser, you can override the =compilers= list
before calling the =setup()= like this:
#+begin_src lua
require('orgmode.utils.treesitter.install').compilers = { 'clang' }
require('orgmode').setup()
#+end_src
After that, restart Neovim and run =:Org install_treesitter_grammar= to reinstall the parser.

[[https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/wiki/Windows-support#which-c-compiler-will-be-used][nvim-treesitter]] mentions the similar issue as part of their Windows troubleshooting section.

** Dates are not in English
Dates are generated with Lua native date support, and it reads your current locale when creating them.
#+HTML: <br/>
To use different locale you can add this to your ~init.lua~:

#+BEGIN_SRC lua
vim.cmd('language en_US.utf8')
#+END_SRC

Just make sure you have ~en_US~ locale installed on your system. To see what you have available on the system you can
start the command ~:language~ and press ~<TAB>~ to autocomplete possible options.

** Chinese characters are not displayed correctly in agenda
In case you use chinese characters in your Neovim, and characters appear as encoded,
try setting the language to =zh_CN.UTF-8= with the same command as above:

#+begin_src lua
vim.cmd('language zh_CN.utf8')
#+end_src

See related issue: [[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode/issues/879]]

** Links are not concealed
Links are concealed with Vim's conceal feature (see ~:help conceal~). To enable concealing, add this to your ~init.lua~:

#+BEGIN_SRC lua
vim.opt.conceallevel = 2
vim.opt.concealcursor = 'nc'
#+END_SRC

** Jumping to file path is not working for paths with forward slash
If you are using Windows, paths are by default written with backslashes.
To use forward slashes, you must enable ~shellslash~ option
(see ~:help shellslash~).

#+BEGIN_SRC lua
vim.opt.shellslash = true
#+END_SRC
